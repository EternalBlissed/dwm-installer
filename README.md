## My DWM Config + Install script

### Install (If you want to for some reason)
```
git clone "https://github.com/eternalblissed/DWM-Install"
cd DWM-Install
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
## Please note
- This is tailored for me, there will be bloat.
- This is catppuccin themed by default.
- This script has only been tested with an archinstall minimal profile installed with no audio driver selected.
- I highly, highly recommend forking this and modding it to your liking.
- If you fork it, you should expect to deal with c and bash.
